# Chemical-Entity-Recognition--NLP
The main challenge addressed in this project is the accurate recognition of chemical entities from a given text, specifically focusing on the CHEMDNER dataset. The CHEMDNER dataset is a comprehensive collection of annotated biomedical articles that include mentions of chemical entities. Despite the importance of chemical entity recognition in the biomedical domain, relatively few works have been devoted to exploring this dataset and developing accurate NER models for chemical entities. 

The primary goal of this project is to develop a robust and accurate Named Entity Recognition model to recognize and classify chemical entities from biomedical text. To achieve this, we fine-tune a pre-trained BERT model and RoBERTa model on the CHEMDNER dataset and evaluate its performance using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score. By enhancing the performance of chemical NER, we aim to contribute to the broader field of biomedical text mining, ultimately supporting researchers and medical professionals in extracting valuable information from the growing body of biomedical literature.
